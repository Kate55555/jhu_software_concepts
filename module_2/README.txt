Module 2 - Web Scraping

Approach: This project uses Python 3.13.2. To run the program, download the module_2 files and type python run.py.
The file run.py operates two classes - Scrape and Clean - that help with data dumps and then building a JSON file.
The program starts with the cleaning part, because the source data was scraped and saved to the 'html' folder in advance. To redo scraping, uncomment the line 22 in run.py that says Scrape().scrape_data(url, n).

After studying the robots.txt file, we conclude that the Gradcafe site does not prevent us from web scraping. The file robots.txt is attached.

Known Bugs: None
