Module 2 - Web Scraping

Approach: This project uses Python 3.13.2. To run the program, download the module_2 files and type python run.py.
The file run.py operates two classes - Scrape and Clean - that help with data dumps and then building a JSON file.

After studying the robots.txt file, we conclude that the Gradcafe site does not prevent us from web scraping. The file robots.txt is attached.

Known Bugs: None
