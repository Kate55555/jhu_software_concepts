In my gap year, I got a job as a Behaviour Interventionist, volunteered at a Brain Injury Society doing intake interviews with Brain Injury survivors, redid my letter of interest with a Career Advisor, and asked an SLP Alumni from U of A to write my reference letter. One of my referees wasn't able to get their reference letter in on time, and they still accepted my application with just 2 references. If you're applying to U of A for SLP my best advice is to job shadow as many SLPs as you can, try gaining work experience in related fields, and focus on your letter of interest and reference letters.

Each year we receive many more applications than can be accommodated; consequently, we are unable to admit many highly qualified students.  \r\r\n\r\r\nThank you again for your interest in the University of Virginia.

You may register for the Fall 2025 semester.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe appreciate your application to the Department of Anthropology. While the Department of Anthropology was not able to offer you admission, we very much hope you would consider pursuing a master's in Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS). After a special review of applications, yours was selected by CLACS due to your research interests and profile. We feel that you may be interested in the interdisciplinary master's program in the Center. An MA from CLACS is your next step in furthering a career related to Latin America or the Caribbean, and CLACS alumni have gone on to doctoral programs at NYU, Duke, Princeton, Yale, USC, and UT Austin, among a number of others. Our location in New York City, furthermore, gives you access to one of the most exciting and intellectually stimulating cities in the world.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe regret to add that there are no fellowships or scholarships available to you through the Graduate School or your program. In the Other Resources section of the Admitted Student Resource Page (see link below), you will find information detailing other sources of funding.

As mentioned in my last email, in order to give every application the thorough assessment it deserved, close readings were done by faculty members, which were then discussed with sub-field colleagues, who subsequently shared their impressions with our entire admissions committee.  As Chair of the Anthropology Admissions Committee I always find it exciting to learn about the accomplishments and academic goals of our applicants!\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, very late in the cycle, when departments were preparing to submit acceptance nominations to our Graduate Division, admissions deliberations encountered an atypical wrinkle that further lengthened our deliberations. As you are likely aware, uncertainties around the status of Federal grants and contracts for research and education have impacted the admissions postures of many universities. UC Santa Cruz is among the many institutions adjusting to this budgetary uncertainty, and our Graduate Division determined the need to dramatically scale back admissions for fall 2025. \r\r\n\r\r\nThis will make for an exceptionally lean admissions picture for UCSC Anthropology \u2013 perhaps the most competitive in our program\u2019s history.  While the UCSC Graduate Division will be sending official decision letters very soon, I wanted to communicate with you personally, to thank you for the time and care you gave your application, and to provide context for the difficult decisions we had to make this year.\r\r\n\r\r\nWishing you the very best as you pursue your academic goals\u201d"}, {"program": "Physics, Rice University", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 20, 2025", "status": "Wait listed on 20 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/981001", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International"}, {"program": "Economics, University of California, Irvine", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 20, 2025", "status": "Wait listed on 24 Feb", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/981000", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International", "comments": "Please decline if you have dominating offers, thank you!"}, {"program": "Economics, CUNY", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 20, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 21 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/980999", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "GRE": "GRE 170", "GRE V": "GRE V 166", "GRE AW": "GRE AW 4.50", "GPA": "GPA 4.00", "comments": "Masters: #1 UK | Undergrad: MSI Will likely reject regardless due to dominant offers"}, {"program": "(UIC), University of Illinois Chicago", "Degree": "Economics", "date_added": "Added on PhD", "status": "March 19, 2025", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/980998", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "GRE": "GRE 329", "GRE V": "GRE V 160", "GRE AW": "GRE AW 4.50", "GPA": "GPA 4.00", "comments": "GPA from master's degree"}, {"program": "Economics, University of Toronto", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 19, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 14 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/980997", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "GRE": "GRE 329", "GRE V": "GRE V 160", "GRE AW": "GRE AW 4.50", "GPA": "GPA 4.00", "comments": "GPA from master's degree"}, {"program": "Economics, University of California, Berkeley", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 19, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 13 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/980996", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "GRE": "GRE 129", "GRE V": "GRE V 160", "GRE AW": "GRE AW 4.50", "GPA": "GPA 4.00", "comments": "GPA from master's degree"}, {"program": "(UIC), University of Illinois Chicago", "Degree": "Philosophy", "date_added": "Added on PhD", "status": "March 19, 2025", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/980995", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "comments": "2a/4w/12r/3p.

Our goal is to achieve a sound match between the strengths of our programs and the interests of the relatively small number of outstanding students that can be accommodated.\r\r\n\r\r\nUnfortunately, due to the volume of applications which we receive, it is not possible for the department or the Graduate School to go back and review applications to justify the denial or offer advice on fortifying a future application.\r\r\n\r\r\nI wish you success in your plans for graduate study and thank you for considering Princeton University."}, {"program": "Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins University", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 11, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 11 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/977832", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "comments": "MPH 4.0 GPA from highly ranked school of public health, 4 publications (2 first author), 2 publications in progress, 5 years of field experience, international non-profit founder.

In terms of work experience, I tend to think that they look for potential rather than CV, since I know people with 1, 2 or 3 years of experience in consulting/engineering who got rejected. Ask yourself why this is the right program for you (and not a MiM at HEC Paris for example) and be able to explain it in a good motivation letter. Also, I believe that for masters there is hundreds of chinese and indian students who apply to European unis, which maybe plays against them all, because there is really not a way to differentiate between the top unis in Asia (moral of the story: try to get a well rounded profile rather than focusing your time during the bachelor in being top 1 of the class)."}, {"program": "Economics, George Washington University", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 11, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 11 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/977613", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International", "comments": "waitlisted for funding"}, {"program": "Chemistry, University of Washington", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 11, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 10 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/977612", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International", "comments": "\"Your application indicates your interest in being considered for admission to our MS in Applied Chemical Sciences and Technology (MSACST) program.

Next day Huang replied saying the application is still under review which made me think about what was the final decision. I escalated the issue to the dean about different emails and after that nobody has replied. I came to know from other students that they only prefer their masters students and external students are only invited to inflate the application numbers. I unnecessarily lost my application fee.

Use your application to explain why you are passionate to be an SLP, and how NU will assist you in following your passions! The app is 4 questions. That's it. Your answers and LORs are everything.

Attended three summer NSF REU programs, one summer school in experimental cosmology, and one summer school in experimental particle physics Worked as a teaching assistant in physics for three years as an undergraduate, and have spent the past year working as a part-time instructor and tutor in physics at the local community college. Contributed to several widely-used open-source software projects made use of in cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy physics (including two CERN packages). Also completed a year-long senior thesis with a professor doing cosmology research at an external institution (in addition to the research I had been conducting at my home institution). \r\r\n\r\r\nI don't have the slightest clue what went wrong. I significantly revamped my CV and essays this year. I also used three entirely different recommenders. I think this is it for me and physics. Good luck to everyone else."}, {"program": "Communication, University of Iowa", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 6 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975858", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American"}, {"program": "Statistics, Columbia University", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 6 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975857", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International"}, {"program": "Physics, University of Colorado Boulder", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 6 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975856", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International", "GPA": "GPA 3.96"}, {"program": "Regional Planning, Cornell University", "Degree": "Masters", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 25 Feb", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975855", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "GPA": "GPA 3.89", "comments": "\u201c Those selected for aid will receive a follow-up email with additional information in very early March.\u201d Has anyone heard back about aid?"}, {"program": "Management, University of Houston", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 6 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975854", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International"}, {"program": "Interdisciplinary Life and Environmental Science Landscape Award (ILESLA), University of Oxford", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Rejected on 21 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975853", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "comments": "MSc from UK school\r\r\nInvited to interview 2/20 and virtual interview held on 2/27"}, {"program": "Economics, Iowa State University", "Degree": "PhD", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 6 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975852", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International", "GPA": "GPA 4.00"}, {"program": "Graphic Design & Digital Media, Academy of Art University", "Degree": "Masters", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 21 Oct", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975851", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International", "GPA": "GPA 3.98", "comments": "MA"}, {"program": "Speech Language Pathology, George Washington University", "Degree": "Masters", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 7 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975850", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International"}, {"program": "Transdisciplinary Design, Parsons The New School For Design", "Degree": "MFA", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 17 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975849", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "International", "GPA": "GPA 3.98", "comments": ""}, {"program": "History and Library Science (HiLS), University of Maryland", "Degree": "Masters", "date_added": "Added on March 06, 2025", "status": "Accepted on 6 Mar", "url": "https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/975848", "term": "Fall 2025", "US/Internaional": "American", "GPA": "GPA 3.60", "comments": "Rejected by history department.
